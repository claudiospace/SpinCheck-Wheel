SpinCheck Wheel
======================

:star: Hey there,

The SpinCheck Wheel was built to help on the task of selecting a checkin or checkout question from a variety of curated practical, reflexive and creative prompts.

This still a **prototype** with a lot of room from technical improvement, such as reading questions from a external JSON file, adding song to the spin, offering a filtering option by category type (practical, reflexive, creative, etc), and more.

You can find a live demo of the wheel [in my website](https://edutechxd.com/tools/spincheck/index.html).
