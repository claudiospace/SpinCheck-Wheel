SpinCheck Wheel
======================

:star: Hey there,

The SpinCheck Wheel was built to help with the task of selecting a check-in or checkout question from a variety of curated, practical, reflexive and creative prompts.

This still a **prototype** with a lot of room from technical improvement, such as implementing the reading of prompts from a external JSON file (the prompts are currently implemented as an array inside the script.js file), adding song to the spin, offering a filtering option by category type (focused, reflexive, creative, etc), and more.

You can see a live demo of the wheel [on my website](https://spincheck.edutechxd.com/).
